Rules for all agents programming in Python to follow!

- Never use a try/except clause! Don't worry about exception handling, unless I specifically tell you to.
- Never use emojis in your print statements!
- Don't add too many comments; keep your comments sparse! Docstrings are great, however.
- Never use a hasattr() or getattr() method! This is stupid and overly complex. You can find a better way to implement the logic. For getattr(), you can just reference the attribute normally.
